      <h3>Our Project: Digital Route Planning for Users of Wheelchairs and Other Mobility Devices</h3>
      <p>Individuals who use wheelchairs and other mobility devices have unique needs and goals when using route-planning applications such as Google Maps. These users rely on map applications to plan their route and arrive at their destination, but the lack of accessibility information makes it impossible to accurately plan an accessible route.</p>
